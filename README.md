# Matasano Crypto Challenges
A long while ago I signed up for the Matasano Crypto Challenges but never really
found the time to work on them. After a while the fine folks behind these
challenges published all of them at http://cryptopals.com/.

I finally forced myself to take the time to work on the challenges, I will
document my progress here, and I hope that over time people will stumble over my
solutions and take the time to tell me where I can do better.
## Organization of the repo
Each set of challenges has its own directory. The challenges directory contains
a clone of the cryptopals website, because I frequently work on the challenges
while commuting, and internet access is often not available. The file `helpers.py`
contains code snippets to work with encoding/decoding strings, most of the crypto
implementations are in there, and so on; basically, as soon as I need a prticular
piece of code more than once it will move into the helpers module.
