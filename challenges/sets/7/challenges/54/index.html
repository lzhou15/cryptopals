          <h3>Kelsey and Kohno's Nostradamus Attack</h3>
          <p>
  Hash functions are sometimes used as proof of a secret prediction.
</p>
<p>
  For example, suppose you wanted to predict the score of every Major
  League Baseball game in a season. (2,430 in all.) You might be
  concerned that publishing your predictions would affect the
  outcomes.
</p>
<p>
  So instead you write down all the scores, hash the document, and
  publish the hash. Once the season is over, you publish the
  document. Everyone can then hash the document to verify your
  soothsaying prowess.
</p>
<p>
  But what if you can't accurately predict the scores of 2.4k baseball
  games? Have no fear - forging a prediction under this scheme reduces
  to another second preimage attack.
</p>
<p>
  We could apply the long message attack from the previous problem, but
  it would look pretty shady. Would you trust someone whose predicted
  message turned out to be 2^50 bytes long?
</p>
<p>
  It turns out we can run a successful attack with a much shorter
  suffix. Check the method:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Generate a large number of initial hash states. Say, 2^k.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pair them up and generate single-block collisions. Now you have
    2^k hash states that collide into 2^(k-1) states.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat the process. Pair up the 2^(k-1) states and generate
    collisions. Now you have 2^(k-2) states.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep doing this until you have one state. This is your
    prediction.
  </li>
  <li>
    Well, sort of. You need to commit to some length to encode in the
    padding. Make sure it's long enough to accommodate your actual
    message, this suffix, and a little bit of glue to join them
    up. Hash this padding block using the state from step 4 - THIS is
    your prediction.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  What did you just build? It's basically a funnel mapping many initial
  states into a common final state. What's critical is we now have a big
  field of 2^k states we can try to collide into, but the actual suffix
  will only be k+1 blocks long.
</p>
<p>
  The rest is trivial:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Wait for the end of the baseball season. (This may take some
    time.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Write down the game results. Or, you know, anything else. I'm not
    too particular.
  </li>
  <li>
    Generate enough glue blocks to get your message length right. The
    last block should collide into one of the leaves in your
    tree.
  </li>
  <li>
    Follow the path from the leaf all the way up to the root node and
    build your suffix using the message blocks along the way.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The difficulty here will be around 2^(b-k). By increasing or
  decreasing k in the tree generation phase, you can tune the difficulty
  of this step. It probably makes sense to do more work up-front, since
  people will be waiting on you to supply your message once the event
  passes. Happy prognosticating!
